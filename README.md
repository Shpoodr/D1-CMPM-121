# CMPM 121 D1 Project

Made a potato clicker game inspired by cookie clicker where the player begins by clicking a potato to gain more potatos. Eventuallt they will
have enough potatos and they will use those to buy upgrades. So the gain is potatos and the currency is potatos. I considered ccreating a method of 
selling the potatos but decided that I didn't want to do that due to time constraints. So the final product has a potato you can click and 5 differnet upgrades
that you can buy that will increase your potatos per second (this will show up on the potatos per second section. Also, the upgrades will increase in price as they are bought.
